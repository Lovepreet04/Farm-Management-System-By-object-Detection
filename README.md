# Farm Management System
Overview

The Farm Management System is a comprehensive application designed to monitor plant health, detect diseases, and enhance agricultural productivity using real-time computer vision techniques. This project leverages advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms to provide farmers with valuable insights into their crops.

Key Features

Real-time Webcam Monitoring: Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection to monitor plants and identify specific classes of interest.

Leaf Detection: Implements color detection to identify healthy leaves and capture images for further analysis.

Disease Prediction: Integrates a plant disease prediction model to analyze captured leaf images and provide insights on potential diseases.

User -Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter, the application features an intuitive interface for easy interaction and control.
